# Assignment: Sr. Front-End web developer

This assignment is for us to test the abilities of a Senior Front-End web developer.

## Task 1:
Build the following page [FIGMA LINK](https://www.figma.com/file/SR8UZ7A0HhGMPm1zfBOqwg/baraka---dev?type=design&node-id=0-16173&mode=design&t=87vPsddffqQ3erAm-0)

### Required Technologies:
- NextJS
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- ESLint

### Requirements
1. The page should look good on all modern browsers and should be optimised for desktop use. No mobile responsiveness is necessary, but it should look correct on large desktop displays as well as small laptop displays.
2. The page loading time should be short.
3. While this is just a temporary project, the code should still be readable and maintainable.
4. NOTE: For this task, the graphs do not have to be dynamic, and can simply be exported as images. See [Bonus Task 2](#bonus-task-2) for a challenge.

## Bonus Task 1:â€¨
Use an AI tool to translate the copy, and create an Arabic version of the page. Both translations should be accessible via `/en` and `/ar` urls, and any user should be able to switch languages.
If you are able to provide the translation yourself, feel free to do so. 

## Bonus Task 2:
Implement the graphs with a graphing library of your choice. Make as many assumptions as you need about the data.

The two graphs we are most interested in are:
1. Investment Forecast line graph
2. Asset Allocation pie-chart

## Bonus Task 3:
Write an automated test to make sure that the page will build and deploy safely. You may choose which testing framework to use.

## Bonus Task 4:
Write a GitHub action that will run your automated test when a PR is opened into the `main` branch.

# Submission Criteria: 
1. Create a GitHub repository that shows your work clearly.
2. Add a clear readme that explains the project and how to spin it up.
3. If you are able to do so, deploy your page to a free web deployment platform such as [vercel](https://vercel.com/new) or [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/with/nextjs/#deploy).
4. Share your GitHub link and deployed app URL with your recruiter.

## Project Deadline
Take your time but try to deliver it within 1 week from receiving the assignment brief. Try to complete at least [Task 1](#task-1) within this time. The bonus tasks may be completed in any order.

## Quality Assurance
What you need to do to get a high QA score? Simply answer **Yes** to all these questions:

### General
- Are all requirements set above met?
- Is the page working without any JS errors or warnings?

### Precision
- Does the page look like the design in figma?
- Have the right px and percetnage values been used to make the page reasonably responsive?

### Browser check
- Does page display and work correctly in modern browsers? (Safari, Firefox, Chrome)

### Semantic Markup
- Are the correct tags being used?

### Optimization
- Are image files sufficiently compressed?

### Accessibility
- Are proper ALT attributes for images provided?
- Are ARIA attributes properly used?
- Is proper heading structure in place?

# Good luck!
