# Assignment: Sr. Front-End web developer

This assignment is for us to test the abilities of a Senior Front-End web developer.

## Task 1:
Build the following page [FIGMA LINK]

### Required Technologies:
- NextJS
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- ESLint

### Requirements
1. The page should look good on all modern browsers and should be optimised for desktop use. No mobile responsiveness is necessary, but it should look correct on large desktop displays as well as small laptop displays.
2. The page loading time should be short.
3. While this is just a temporary project, the code should still be readable and maintainable.

## Bonus Task 1:â€¨
Use an AI tool to translate the copy, and create an Arabic version of the page. Both translations should be accessible via `/en` and `/ar` urls, and any user should be able to switch languages.
If you are able to provide the translation yourself, feel free to do so. 

## Bonus Task 2:
Write an automated test to make sure that the page will build and deploy safely. You may choose which testing framework to use.

## Bonus Task 3:
Write a GitHub action that will run your automated test when a PR is opened into the `main` branch.

# Submission Criteria: 
1. Create a GitHub repository that shows your work clearly.
2. Add a clear readme that explains the project and how to spin it up.
3. If you are able to do so, deploy your page to a free web deployment platform such as vercel or netlify.
4. Share your deployed app URL and GitHub link with our recruiter.

## Project Deadline
Take your time but try to deliver it within 1 week time.

## Quality Assurance

### General
